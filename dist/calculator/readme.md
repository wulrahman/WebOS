> This repo have the same [codepen](https://codepen.io/jsalazart/full/jJWMVw) files and code. <br>
> `VueJs 2.6.7` `Typescript v2.8.1` `SCSS v3.5.6` <br>
> This small repo/project is just for educational purpose, is not component oriented, ready to production neither, and maybe is not the best approach.
